# Views Overview

SolidOS provides various views (also known as *panes*) that allow you to interact with different types of data in your Solid Pod. Each view is designed to handle specific data types and use cases.

## Primary Views

These are the main views for working with social and collaborative data:

- **Default** - Standard social views available to all users
- **Power User** - Additional views like Meeting, Note Pad, and Scheduled Event
- **Developer** - Technical views like Data, N3, and RDF/XML

See the [User Roles](/reference/user-roles) reference for a complete list of which views are available for each role.
