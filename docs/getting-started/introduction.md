# Introduction to SolidOS

[Solid](https://solidproject.org/) empowers users and organizations to separate their data from the applications that use it. It allows people to look at the same data with different apps at the same time. It opens brand new avenues for creativity, problem-solving, and commerce.

[SolidOS Databrowser Frontend](https://github.com/solidos), which we name SolidOS for simplicity, is intended to be extremely flexible and provide all the basic functionality to allow people to easily manage data on Solid, be that social core with contact management and collaborate with your friends, or the more complex use cases, such as a researcher organizing their data and research on a variety of data sources.

SolidOS is your de-facto default interface to Solid, enabling you to create, share and collaborate on data stored within Solid Pods with your friends and contacts through social networks and applications. Using SolidOS, you can coordinate all of your data in an interface that can be configured and extended to support all of your needs on Solid.

## Accessing Data

To access the data stored in a Solid Pod via the SolidOS:

1. In a web browser, navigate to the root Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Pod you want to access (e.g., [`https://suser.solidcommunity.net`](https://suser.solidcommunity.net))
2. You will see a view of the public data within the Pod:

![Home View (Public)](/img/Public_Home.png)

You can see different views of the data by clicking the various View icons just below the header. For example, the Folder view:

![Folder View (Public)](/img/Public_Folder.png)

:::tip
To return to the default View, click the Solid icon in the top-left corner of the SolidOS.

:::note
- When viewing another person's pod, make sure to add the origin of that pod as a trusted app on your own profile.
- When viewing another person's pod, if you want to make use of Developer or PowerUser features, you need to set your preferences file (often found at `/settings/prefs.ttl` in your pod) to be world-readable.
