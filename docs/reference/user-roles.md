# User Roles

There are many views (also known as *panes*) available through the Databrowser that provide access to a wealth of functionality. However, users can sometimes feel overwhelmed by the large number of available options when accessing resources within their Pod.

To improve the user experience, not to mention the onboarding process for new users, the Databrowser views that are displayed for a particular resource are based on the user's selected role(s). By default, all users can view all of the standard social views. Selecting one or more optional advanced role(s) enables more advanced views:

- **Developer** — View Data, N3, and RDF views of the data.
- **Power User** — View additional Databrowser views such as [Note Pad](/views/notepad) and [Meeting](/views/meeting).

:::note
- An exception may be made to the views displayed for a given resource if it makes sharing resources easier.
- Your selected role(s) are stored in your settings which are private by default.

## Setting Your Role

To update your role:

1. Click on your profile image in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Preferences** from the dropdown menu.
3. Select your optional role(s) from the Roles listbox.
4. Click off the listbox.

:::tip
- Multiple Roles can be selected by holding down the Shift or Command key on your keyboard.
- You need to refresh your web browser for the role changes to take effect.
